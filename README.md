# Team Members Section for Your Website

Team members section for your website. Initially hide the description/overview of the team members and only display the description/overview about the specific team member once someone click on a specific team member's profile photo or name. Very light weight, fast loading and responsive web page for team members section. Easily convert it as WordPress template or create a new Custom Post Type so you can add team members very easily from your WordPress Dashboard.

## Why It's Helpful

If you have multiple team members on your team, it'll take huge space if you want to show their biography/overview. It will require huge scrolling for your visitors if they want to see next team member's profile/biography.

**So we thought that it's better if we hide team member's biography initially and only show specific member's biography depending on your visitors interest (if they click anyone's profile photo or name).**
